Welcome to Recca! Our app is centered around the one thing we all love: entertainment. With so much of it available to consume, it can be difficult to organize and keep track of of it all. With Recca, a user can search, save, track, and recommend their favorite movies, music, books, shows, and video games!

When a user searches for the media of their choice, they are presented with the options to Save and Recommend. Saving will store it in their respective Saved bank, and some additional options will open up. Once saved, you can still Recommend, but you can now set to Active, Complete, or Remove as well. The sidebar on the right will track your Active and Complete media.

But what else do we love about entertainment? We love telling our friends about it! Recca allows users to send and receive friend requests, and use the Recommend feature to tell all your friends what you love about your current favorite show! Recca's homepage is the User Feed, which displays all your friends' recommendations. Now, instead of telling them "Yeah, I'll check that out...", and forgetting about it &mdash; you can directly save it from the Feed and always remember it's on your list!

Recca is the perfect app to organize all your media, and the social functionality makes it the perfect place to talk about all your favorites with your friends!

Please sign up, tell your friends, and enjoy Recca!
